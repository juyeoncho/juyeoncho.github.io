# About

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of [Linguistics and Cognitive Science at the University of Delaware.](https://www.lingcogsci.udel.edu) I am a member of Experimental Syntax Lab. My research focuses on syntax, semantics and psycholinguistics. I am interested in how experimental measures elucidate the sources of processing ease/difficulty and advance our understanding of the relationship between language use and cognitive mechanisms.

### Research interests

- Syntax
- Syntax/Semantics interface
- Psycholinguistics
- East Asian languages
