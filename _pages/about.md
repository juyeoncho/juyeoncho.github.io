Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of [Linguistics and Cognitive Science at the University of Delaware.](https://www.lingcogsci.udel.edu) My research focuses on syntax, semantics and psycholinguistics. I am interested in how experimental measures elucidate the sources of processing ease/difficulty and advance our understanding of the relationship between language use and cognitive mechanisms.


### Research interests

- Syntax
- Syntax/Semantics interface
