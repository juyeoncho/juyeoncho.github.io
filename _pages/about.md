Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of [Linguistics and Cognitive Science at the University of Delaware](https://www.lingcogsci.udel.edu), with a research focus on experimental syntax-semantics and psycholinguistics. My primary interest lies in understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying syntactic processing, employing various experimental methods. In my ongoing project, I am exploring the impact of various grammatical cues, such as case marking, on subject advantage in different languages.
