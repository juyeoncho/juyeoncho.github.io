Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of [Linguistics and Cognitive Science at the University of Delaware.](https://www.lingcogsci.udel.edu) My research focuses on syntax, semantics and psycholinguistics. I am interested in understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying syntactic processing, using various experimental measures. My current project investigates how subject advantage is influenced by different types of grammatical cues (such as case marking) in languages.
